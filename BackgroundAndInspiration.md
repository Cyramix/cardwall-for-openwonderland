Card Wall is derived from the physical card walls used by agile teams.  In the physical world, user stories are written on index cards and form the backlog. These stories are estimated in some form of units. This part of the process is called release planning. The backlog is prioritized by the product owner and the stories with the highest priorities become the items to be done in the current iteration. Typically, based on the previous iteration (called "Yesterdays weather" in the XP vernacular) the value of stories selected are approximately equal to the work previously completed.  This cards are moved into the "To Do" section.  As stories are started, they are moved into "In Progress" and then moved to "Completed."   In the XP world, a second wall could be used for tasks that are broken down out of the stories. This is iteration planning.
