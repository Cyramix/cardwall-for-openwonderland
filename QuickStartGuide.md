# Requirements #
  * [OpenWonderland](http://www.openwonderland.org) - Version 0.5 Preview 4 or later

# Installation #

  * Card Wall is installed as a module and requires Darkstar to be restarted.
  * Card Wall is inserted into a world using the Insert Object functionality or by dragging a previously exported .cardwall file

# Usage #
  * User takes control in the usual fashion through the context menu item "Take Control"
  * New cards are added to a section with the Add button (if there are no spaces, the card will not be created)
  * The user can edit the title and the body by typing in the appropriate field - I have added two new fields at the bottom of a card - in the agile world one is for the person who has accepted the task and the other is for the estimate points (or time) to complete the item.
  * The user can drag a card from one column to any blank location within the window (there is no drag outline)
  * Cards can be deleted via a popup menu - right click on a coloured area of the card and a menu will appear
  * You can change the colour of the card via the same popup menu (I decided not to use the colour chooser since I wanted this to be an easy operation)
  * You can export the data in a csv file - when you DO NOT have control, right click and there is an option to "Export data" - save the file with the extension .cardwall and you will be able to drag it back into the world and create another instance of cardwall with the data.  NOTE: this format is not cast in stone and I cannot guarentee that you will be able to import it into a later version.
